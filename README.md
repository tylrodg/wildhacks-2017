Wildhacks 2017 was everyone's first hackathon. While our plan didn't come entirely to fruition, we learned a lot and had fun. Tony and Harrison learned a great deal about web development and WebVR and created environments using [A-Frame](aframe.io). I worked with our [Oculus Rift](oculus.com/rift) headset and getting A-Frame working with it. Brian and I also worked with the [Myo](https://www.myo.com/ "Myo Gesture Control Armband") armband, a device that controls events on a computer using gestures and movements. In the end, we all came out of Wildhacks 2017 having learned how to use something new.
